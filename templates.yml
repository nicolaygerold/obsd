      Whenever you're stuck, ask:
      - 🧠 Head: Is this _really_ the right task?
      - ❤️ Heart: Am I excited by this—or afraid/bored?    
      - ✋ Hand: Do I know _how_ to do this?
      - ⚡ What is the biggest lever that I could apply to this? 
      - 🌱 Do I need a recharge? 1-5 minute meditation, make tea, go for a walk

      What are the three things to get done today?

      ### Evening Review

      **Mindest**
      - 🌱 **Insights**: What sparked curiosity or clarity?
      	    
      - ⚡ **Energy**: When did I feel most alive or most drained? When did you get into flow or play mode? 
          
      - 🙂 **Mood**: What emotions showed up?
          
      - 🧍 **Encounters**: Who did I interact with, and how did that feel?

      **Plus, Minus, Next:** 
      - - ➕ What went well?
              
      - ➖ What didn't feel great or caused friction?
      	
      - 🔜 What's your next small move based on that?

      >**Current Pact**: 1 great piece of code each day for the next 30 days. Refactor to make the change, write the tests, make the change. 


      **Mindest:** Review the calendar. Am I working in my peak window? 
      - 🌱 **Insights**: What sparked curiosity or clarity?
      	    
      - ⚡ **Energy**: When did I feel most alive or most drained?
          
      - 🙂 **Mood**: What emotions showed up?
          
      - 🧍 **Encounters**: Who did I interact with, and how did that feel?

      **Plus, Minus, Next:** 
      - ➕ What went well?
              
      - ➖ What didn't feel great or caused friction?
      	
      - 🔜 What's your next small move based on that?

      **Experiments:** Review these weeks experiments. 
      - **What am I testing?**
      		
      - **What am I learning about myself?**
      		
      - **What small risks can I take to explore a path before I commit?**

      **Pact Review:**
      - 🏄 Persist: Is this giving me energy? Let's keep going.
      		
      - 🧘 Pause: Is this draining me? Time to rest.
      		
      - 🛠 Pivot: Can I tweak it to make it work better?

      Give it a fun or clear name (e.g. "Morning Movement Reset" or "Curious Conversations").

      ### 🧩 1. **What am I exploring?**

      > A brief statement of curiosity or challenge.

      > "I'm curious if daily drawing will help me reconnect with creativity."  
      > "I want to see if avoiding screens in the morning improves my mood."

      ---

      ### 🎯 2. **Hypothesis**

      > What do you _think_ might happen?

      > "If I journal for 10 minutes every night, I'll fall asleep faster."  
      > "If I block 2 hours for deep work in the morning, I'll get more done with less stress."

      ---

      ### 📆 3. **Pact (Action + Duration)**

      > Your small, repeatable, trackable commitment.

      **I will** [action] **for** [duration].

      > "I will write 100 words daily for 10 days."  
      > "I will call one friend every Saturday for 4 weeks."

      ### 📓 4. **Field Notes (Log)**

      Use a short bullet or journal-style format. Suggested columns:

      | Date  | Did I do it? | Mood/Energy | Key Insight / Note              |
      | ----- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
      | Day 1 | ✅            | 😌 Calm     | Felt grounded after journaling. |
      | Day 2 | ✅            | 😕 Tired    | Skipped tea—harder to focus.    |
      | …     | …            | …           | …                               |

      ---

      ### ➕➖ 6. **Reflection (End of Experiment)**

      #### ✅ What went well (Plus)?

      > Energy boosts, surprises, insights, consistency…

      #### ❌ What didn't go well (Minus)?

      > Resistance, challenges, friction, emotional patterns…

      #### 🔄 What's next?

      > Will you persist, pause, or pivot? Why?

      > "I want to keep going, but only 3x per week feels more sustainable."
